# Entropy CSS

## Another framework?
Yes, because why not. 

### For whom? 
Many backend developers hate front end development because of confusing CSS frameworks with terrible customizability and unnecessary JavaScript. 

### Using modern CSS
A lot of popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation depend on old CSS features like flexbox and don't utilize modern stuff like CSS Grid, CSS variables and new SCSS features. I'm not shitting on Bootstrap, don't take me wrong. This frameworks is massively inspired by it. I just want play with all those new toys we have.
